This project was the second homework assignment for the U of O full-stack web dev class.  Within the parameters of the assignment, I created a small portfolio page using the Bootstrap framework.  Being an old school html kind of dude, this was a good opportunity for me to familiarize myself with the in and outs of Bootstrap, and to expand my Google-Fu repertoire, if that's a thing.  

I wanted to go with some bright and bold colors, and try some new things with the design, but stay confined to the Bootstrap framework.  All of the images are originals, and some of them are newer than my latest update to my portfolio at mxadam.com.  

Exclusive stuff.  You dig it.

Eventually I'd like to get the contact form to actually work, but since I really didn't want to bang my head against that wall if I didn't have to, it doesn't actually send off any info.  Those things have serious security concerns anyway.

Let me know if you like it, or if you actually read this readme.txt file.

Peace,
M
